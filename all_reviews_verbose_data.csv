165,com.avocsoft.myweeklybudget,My Weekly Budget,2016-09-04,234,"My Weekly Budget® (MyWB) lets you focus on a simple spending target for the current week. Focusing week-by-week on keeping within a spending target helps you meet your budget, and saves you money over time. When using MyWB consistently, it is easy to stay within your means because you are being updated on your spending each time you buy something. This App is easy to use and easy to understand. It is SIMPLE but powerful. First, set yourself a weekly budget target. Then enter your spending with a uniquely simple, straight forward interface and instantly see whether you are meeting your budget. MyWB also shows you how much of your set budget you have at any given day of the week. The goal of this App is to help you control your spending with minimal effort. The App is flexible enough to allow you to customize features to match your needs. There is also a quick and easy way to flick through your spending patterns from previous weeks - so you can get a clear view of where you have been spending your money. At the end of each week, a brief summary for the week is presented showing how well (or badly?!) you have done against your target. Any money not spent may be carried over to the next week, so you can reward yourself with higher spending next week! Any money you received (birthday presents, cash-back on a pair of shoes you returned etc.) may also be added to your current week's spending plan if you choose. MyWB supports your local currency and several other international currencies. You can show the date format to your liking, organize spending in categories as broad or as focused as you want, and includes the option to make your own categories to show personalized descriptions of your spending. You can also export your spending information from MyWB by email so you can use it in other applications on your computer. Do you find money slipping through your fingers? Not knowing where your hard-earned cash goes? Maybe you just need an occasional message to remind you what you were planning to spend this week? This is the App for you!

This is how it happens with the app and it generates the time as well as the numbers, being the closest simulation to the real lottery draw. You can choose how many even and odd numbers generate the app and play. Players may pick 6 different numbers from 1 to 49. You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing. In a typical 6/49 game, six numbers are drawn from a range of 49 and if the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner - this is true no matter in which order the numbers appear. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.There are three types of probabilities, each differing only in interpretation but still subject to the same rules:Mathematical    The theoretical development based on equally likely outcomes and their far-reaching generalization into measure theory. Empirical    Events are assigned probabilities based on empirical observations from the past. Subjective    This was championed by the Italian mathematician Bruno de Finetti and views probabilities as personal reflections of an individual's opinion about an event. The probabilities associated with Lotto 6/49 are determined by calculations based on equally likely outcomes but their interpretation is empirical, as follows. If an experiment (such as a weekly Lotto drawing) is repeated under similar conditions many times (mathematically the requisite number of times must approach infinity) then the probability of an event is the long run proportion of experimental repetitions on which the event occurs. (This is called a law of large numbers. It is a mathematical result only.) As illustration, the probability of obtaining a fourth place prize is 0.0009686. This means that in 26,000 Lotto draws, each particular choice of six numbers will yield a fourth place prize (matching exactly 4 numbers) on approximately 0.0009686 of those plays, that is 26000 x 0.000986 = 25 times. There is no guarantee that this will happen 25 times. The actual number of times is random and subject to what is called the Poisson approximation. The figure of 25 represents an expected number of winnings and is a useful measure by which to compare the performance of different strategies.Odd numbers are those which end in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 while even numbers are those which end in 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. You are more likely to win if your odd-even number combination is either 2-4, 3-3 or 4-2. More than 70% of the winning combinations in all the lotteries 6/49 in the past two years are in these category.----------TIPS: Generate almost equal numbers odd/even, until you see your favorite number.

568,com.kizbit.pairfinder,PairFinder,2016-09-04,0,"PairFinder is an app to find cointegrated stocks to pair trade. When two stocks are cointegrated, it means they move in the same direction at the same time. When one stock goes up, the other goes up too, and when one goes down, the other goes down. A regression is calculated on the historical stock prices, and an equation is determined for the stocks. Then one stock is calculated as a multiple of another, plus a constant value, and a 'random' error variable. The random error is calculated at each point by subtracting the expected value of the second stock from its actual value. This random value is then statistically analyzed to determine if it is a 'stationary', 'constant' random variable, or if it drifts and is a 'random walk'. If the probability is > 95%, then it is (most likely) a constant random value, and the two stocks are cointegrated. If the probability is < 95%, then the random variable drifts, and the two stocks are not cointegrated. The cointegration test is an Engle-Granger test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for 'unit roots' in the random value 'residuals'. Pair trading is a method used by advanced hedge funds to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. When stocks A and B are cointegrated, they will normally be the same 'distance' apart. When they diverge or converge, a trading opportunity presents itself for profit. If stocks A and B diverge, A goes up while stock B goes down. A trade is made to sell (short) stock A, and buy (long) stock B. When A and B converge and come back together, then stock A is bought back (buy to cover) and stock B is sold. Pair trading is a low risk, low capital exposure trading strategy. Trade are open for a few days or a few weeks, and the capital required is minimal due to selling and buying stocks at the same time.PairFinder requires a subscription of $0.99/m.

570,com.kizbit.pairfinder,PairFinder,2016-09-06,0,"PairFinder is an app to find cointegrated stocks to pair trade. When two stocks are cointegrated, it means they move in the same direction at the same time. When one stock goes up, the other goes up too, and when one goes down, the other goes down. A regression is calculated on the historical stock prices, and an equation is determined for the stocks. Then one stock is calculated as a multiple of another, plus a constant value, and a 'random' error variable. The random error is calculated at each point by subtracting the expected value of the second stock from its actual value. This random value is then statistically analyzed to determine if it is a 'stationary', 'constant' random variable, or if it drifts and is a 'random walk'. If the probability is > 95%, then it is (most likely) a constant random value, and the two stocks are cointegrated. If the probability is < 95%, then the random variable drifts, and the two stocks are not cointegrated. The cointegration test is an Engle-Granger test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for 'unit roots' in the random value 'residuals'. Pair trading is a method used by advanced hedge funds to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. When stocks A and B are cointegrated, they will normally be the same 'distance' apart. When they diverge or converge, a trading opportunity presents itself for profit. If stocks A and B diverge, A goes up while stock B goes down. A trade is made to sell (short) stock A, and buy (long) stock B. When A and B converge and come back together, then stock A is bought back (buy to cover) and stock B is sold. Pair trading is a low risk, low capital exposure trading strategy. Trade are open for a few days or a few weeks, and the capital required is minimal due to selling and buying stocks at the same time.PairFinder requires a subscription of $0.99/m.

If you haven't already downloaded Expense Manager, the application will walk you through doing so when it is first opened.  It is necessary for both Expense Manager and Expense Manager PRO to be installed on your device.Expense Manager by BluJ IT is an application that was created for business men and women to ease the tracking of business related items such as expenses, mileage, time, and payments for jobs or trips. It has been tailored to allow easy entry of these items throughout a job or trip.  Once the trip or job is complete, the data can be viewed and exported in a variety of ways both as PDF reports and CSV exports. These reports and exports can then be viewed on the device or emailed to whoever needs them.  The CSV export is also great for importing applications such as Quicken and Quickbooks.Features:* Managing different clients with features for bill rates, billing increments, etc.* Creation of jobs and association to clients.* Dynamic job states: Active, Billed, Overdue, and Paid.* Tracking of expenses, mileage, time, and payments within the different jobs.* Fully functional application without network connections; although, when connected exchange rate data is able to be imported into Expense Manager by BluJ Business.* Multinational currency support, including the ability to create and manage custom currencies. Allowing for a preferred currency, unlimited number of currency exchange rates, and currency indication at the expense level.* Exchange Rate data importing from the internet.* Expense tracking with payment method, tags, merchants, notes, and pictures and attachments of receipts (receipt preview included).* Receipt capture makes use of camera functions such as auto-focus, auto-flash, compression, etc.* Mileage tracking in both imperial or metric units. Allowing mileage entry via starting and ending odometer readings as well as total distance.* Time tracking - time can be entered directly by adjusting the hours of the entry, or by starting and stopping a real time clock for the entry. Time entry clocks can be stopped and started as many times as desired, and Expense Manager by BluJ Business will accurately track the total run time of a time entry. Time tracking also allows additional data to be tracked such as (work orders, tags, categories, etc.)* Payment management - as customer payments are received, they too can be tracked within Expense Manager by BluJ Business.

This involves the preparation of financial statements available for public consumption. Stockholders, suppliers, banks, employees, government agencies, business owners, and other stakeholders are examples of people interested in receiving such information for decision making purposes.Financial accountancy is governed by both local and international accounting standards. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction. It includes the standards, conventions and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing and in the preparation of financial statements. On the other hand, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a set of international accounting standards stating how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements. IFRS are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). With IFRS becoming more widespread on the international scene, consistency in financial reporting has become more prevalent between global organisations.While financial accounting is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, management accounting provides accounting information to help managers make decisions to manage the business.International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are designed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries.International Accounting Standards (IAS), while standards issued by IASB are called IFRS. IAS were issued between 1973 and 2001 by the Board of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).","[(accounting, 19), (financial, 15), (standards, 10), (exam, 9), (ifrs, 7), (international, 7), (application, 6), (reporting, 4), (study, 4), (statements, 3)]"
