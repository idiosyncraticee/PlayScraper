      "My Weekly Budget® (MyWB) lets you focus on a simple spending target for the current week.

When using MyWB consistently, it is easy to stay within your means because you are being updated on your spending each time you buy something. This App is easy to use and easy to understand. It is SIMPLE but powerful. First, set yourself a weekly budget target. Then enter your spending with a uniquely simple, straight forward interface and instantly see whether you are meeting your budget. MyWB also shows you how much of your set budget you have at any given day of the week. The goal of this App is to help you control your spending with minimal effort.

At the end of each week, a brief summary for the week is presented showing how well (or badly?!) you have done against your target. Any money not spent may be carried over to the next week, so you can reward yourself with higher spending next week! Any money you received (birthday presents, cash-back on a pair of shoes you returned etc.) may also be added to your current week's spending plan if you choose. MyWB supports your local currency and several other international currencies. You can show the date format to your liking, organize spending in categories as broad or as focused as you want, and includes the option to make your own categories to show personalized descriptions of your spending. You can also export your spending information from MyWB by email so you can use it in other applications on your computer. Do you find money slipping through your fingers? Not knowing where your hard-earned cash goes? Maybe you just need an occasional message to remind you what you were planning to spend this week? This is the App for you!

Presets let you specify a payee and an amount, and you can edit a preset any time if changes are needed.

No surprises!Reconciliation is also easy – Checkbook Genius can bring up a single screen where you can see a total of all your uncleared transactions.  Then you tap another button to automatically create an adjusting entry in your checking account.

      "If you like Delivery Tip Tracker Free, you'll love the Pro version!This is the quickest way to keep track of your delivery tips. Just enter the tip amount using voice or a handy touch menu and Delivery Tip Tracker takes care of the rest. Unlike other apps, there's no need to fill out numerous text fields for every tip you enter. It also automatically generates useful stats like distance driven per delivery, average tip per mile driven, and much more. Pro-exclusive features:• Tip history functionality (daily, monthly, yearly, all-time views)• See your all-time \"high scores\" for various stats• Backup and restore your tip history and settings• Landscape view with custom UI• Track your car's odometer readings• Switch quickly between two store addressesStandard features:• Enter tips using voice or by selecting the tip amount using a simple touch interface• Automatic retrieval of delivery addresses using your phone's GPS• Calculates miles driven on each delivery and dollars earned per mile driven• Tip amount and address editing• Four different mileage options to fit how your store pays mileage• Timestamp for each delivery• Quickly view various stats like average tip, average tip per mile driven, average miles per run, and more• Minimalist interface designed for superior readability under all lighting conditions• Keep track of transactions that don't involve mileage• Option to turn off/on GPS features• Ability to adjust driving distance formula• Option to change address fetch modeWith Delivery Tip Tracker Pro, adding tips using voice is blazing fast. As soon as you add a tip, your phone's GPS automatically pulls the address of your current location to serve as the delivery address. Delivery Tip Tracker automatically calculates how far you've driven for each delivery and displays related stats. Since every store pays out mileage differently, you can configure how your store handles mileage. Using simple radio buttons, you can select whether you're on a single, double, triple, or any other amount. So, if your store pays out different mileage depending on whether you're on a single, double, or triple, the app will automatically add the correct mileage amounts for you. There's also an option for tracking transactions that don't involve mileage, such as in-store tips or gas purchases. I'm open to any feature requests you might have. I'd also love to hear about any feedback or problems you might be having. Just email me!\n",

      "IF YOU ARE ON THIS PAGE MEANS THAT EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON! Increase your winning chances with this app!  This app helps players to choose numbers for Universal Lotteries 6/49 lotto draws. This two-dimensional app generating numbers contains an algorithm, UNIQUE IN THE WORLD that acts like real lottery draws. As in reality, every number is chosen in a certain time. This is how it happens with the app and it generates the time as well as the numbers, being the closest simulation to the real lottery draw. You can choose how many even and odd numbers generate the app and play. Players may pick 6 different numbers from 1 to 49. You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing. In a typical 6/49 game, six numbers are drawn from a range of 49 and if the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner - this is true no matter in which order the numbers appear. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.There are three types of probabilities, each differing only in interpretation but still subject to the same rules:Mathematical    The theoretical development based on equally likely outcomes and their far-reaching generalization into measure theory. Empirical    Events are assigned probabilities based on empirical observations from the past. Subjective    This was championed by the Italian mathematician Bruno de Finetti and views probabilities as personal reflections of an individual's opinion about an event. The probabilities associated with Lotto 6/49 are determined by calculations based on equally likely outcomes but their interpretation is empirical, as follows. If an experiment (such as a weekly Lotto drawing) is repeated under similar conditions many times (mathematically the requisite number of times must approach infinity) then the probability of an event is the long run proportion of experimental repetitions on which the event occurs. (This is called a law of large numbers. It is a mathematical result only.) As illustration, the probability of obtaining a fourth place prize is 0.0009686. This means that in 26,000 Lotto draws, each particular choice of six numbers will yield a fourth place prize (matching exactly 4 numbers) on approximately 0.0009686 of those plays, that is 26000 x 0.000986 = 25 times. There is no guarantee that this will happen 25 times. The actual number of times is random and subject to what is called the Poisson approximation. The figure of 25 represents an expected number of winnings and is a useful measure by which to compare the performance of different strategies.Odd numbers are those which end in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 while even numbers are those which end in 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. You are more likely to win if your odd-even number combination is either 2-4, 3-3 or 4-2. More than 70% of the winning combinations in all the lotteries 6/49 in the past two years are in these category.----------TIPS: Generate almost equal numbers odd/even, until you see your favorite number. Mathematically, these numbers you have to play about 25 times. It is not easy but it is the best way to win!---------For further details or any questions please send me an email at: office@mylotto-app.com Disclaimer: This application has no link in no way with any Lotteries 6/49 organism and it does not allow to participate in the official game of any Lotteries 6/49.

      "PairFinder is an app to find cointegrated stocks to pair trade. When two stocks are cointegrated, it means they move in the same direction at the same time. When one stock goes up, the other goes up too, and when one goes down, the other goes down. A regression is calculated on the historical stock prices, and an equation is determined for the stocks. Then one stock is calculated as a multiple of another, plus a constant value, and a 'random' error variable. The random error is calculated at each point by subtracting the expected value of the second stock from its actual value. This random value is then statistically analyzed to determine if it is a 'stationary', 'constant' random variable, or if it drifts and is a 'random walk'. If the probability is > 95%, then it is (most likely) a constant random value, and the two stocks are cointegrated. If the probability is < 95%, then the random variable drifts, and the two stocks are not cointegrated. The cointegration test is an Engle-Granger test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for 'unit roots' in the random value 'residuals'. Pair trading is a method used by advanced hedge funds to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. When stocks A and B are cointegrated, they will normally be the same 'distance' apart. When they diverge or converge, a trading opportunity presents itself for profit. If stocks A and B diverge, A goes up while stock B goes down. A trade is made to sell (short) stock A, and buy (long) stock B. When A and B converge and come back together, then stock A is bought back (buy to cover) and stock B is sold. Pair trading is a low risk, low capital exposure trading strategy. Trade are open for a few days or a few weeks, and the capital required is minimal due to selling and buying stocks at the same time.PairFinder requires a subscription of $0.99/m.  Background data must be enabled for the license server.Invalid symbols are shown as 0% probability, as are symbols that are missing price history for a given time (ex.

Currently only US exchanges available.* Industry and sector selections, to find pairs within entire industries.* PairTrader, to send pair trading signal notifications when a trade opportunity arises for selected pairs.* Regression coefficients to determine price relationships.* Portfolio and pair allocation based on available capital.PairFinder was created using Java for the app, and Perl and C for the server-side computation.

      "The Forex Dashboard App is the ultimate currency strength/weakness app indicator.It monitors the status of the 8 major currencies, stock indexed and many commodities in real time using the data coming from 6 different time frames: from as short as 15 minutes up to a month of data.INSTRUMENTSThe list of instruments that now you can follow is very long and we added all the major stock indexes as well as all the most important commodities more than doubling the original ones. Here’s the complete list:- AUD – Australian Dollar- CAD – Canadian Dollar- CHF – Swiss Franc- EUR – Euro- GBP – British Sterling- JPY – Japanese Yen- NZD – New Zealand Dollar- USD – US Dollar- GOLD- SILVER (new)- OIL- NATURAL GAS (new)- DOW JONES (new)- STANDARD&POORS 500 (new)- NASDAQ 100 (new)- NIKKEI 225 (new)- EURO STOXX 50 (new)- DAX (new)- CORN (new)- WHEAT (new)- SOYBEAN (new)ALERTSThe app sends audio an visual alerts when an instrument has a score above 80 or below -80 you’ll be alerted immediately in order to look for a potential interesting trade.PAGESYou have 7 pages completely customizable with your sets of instruments. Each page has 3 slots that you can use. Passing from one page to the other is done with a simple swipe left or right. Can’t be easier.AUTOMATIC CONFIGURATION SAVEThe app automatically remembers your pages customization and when you’ll reopen it, you’ll see things as you left them.Why Use Forex Dashboard App?This will give you, not only an overview of the currency situation, but also details on how it is performing in the short term as well.The strength/weakness score goes from -100 to 100 and is calculated using all the pairs in which the currency is involved in. So when for example you see a strong EUR and a weak USD, it means that EUR is strong vs all the other currencies and that the USD is weak versus all the other currencies. This information makes a Long (buy) trade on EURUSD much more interesting.By analysing the single currencies, the Forex Dashboard App will help you choose the best pairs to trade. Simply take the currency or the currencies that are stronger and match with those that are weaker.You can easily spot them as the stronger ones have green histograms while the weaker ones are red.Also, when the score is greater than 80 or lower than -80, the text label of the period becomes green or red accordingly.This can be an interesting entry signal... or at least the first half of it. Now, to be sure, you need another pair that in the same time frame is giving the opposite signal. At this point you can enter a Long (buy) OR Short (sell) trade on that pair.Depending on the time frame, you should have different targets ranging from a few pips to whatever works best on the time frame you are trading. It can be that easy!How To Trade With The Forex Dashboard App?You can trade the Forex Dashboard App on its own by using the signals described above, or (even better) integrate it into your trading system and it'll help you in your trading decisions. The strength and weakness of two currencies can easily help you understand the trend of a pair. From the long term to the short term. Remember... the trend is your friend and the best trends come when there is a divergence between two currencies, i.e. when one is strong and the other is weak.IMPORTANT:- Remember that the Forex Market is open between Sunday night at around 10PM UT up to Friday night at the about the same time. So, during the weekend, currency scores won't change.- The Forex Dashboard App uses data coming from the Internet so please check you have enough credit if used on mobile networks!- The app automatically keeps the screen on so if you want to dim it, press the power button.Info: info@pimpmyea.comSupport: support@pimpmyea.comhttp://PimpMyEA.com\n",

      "Trading Diary is an application that will help you to become better trader.As you know it's a good practice for a trader to have his Trading Diary because it's very important to keep track of your trades and study them carefully.A lot of master traders encourage new traders to keep a trading diary but not a lot of new traders really do that. They affirm that by keeping a journal, the success can be achieved faster.With Trading Diary you will be able to: - update your trading diary while continuing seeing the charts- update your trading diary even when you are not in front of your computer- analyze your trades everywhere, even when you are in the bed just before you are going to sleep- add up to four images of what you were seeing when you made the trade - export your trading journal to PDF, so it can be easily printed or shared with a master trader who will give you an advice- add up to 5 custom fields- calculate the amount of risk you can take, based on your account size and the risk percentage- easily understand where you are by looking at the statistics and the profit chartPeople who downloaded the trading diary have written me that their trading improved a lot since they use the Trading Diary Android application.Eventually, it will be more useful to read your trading diary, than reading a new book. But by doing both you’ll be closer to the trading success. If you have any problems, questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. I will answer you as soon as I can.\n",

      "Kids Bux – a revolutionary way to track your children’s chores and allowance! Unlike other apps, you DON’T HAVE TO TRACK EACH CHORE EACH DAY! No more tedious data entry for parents with the Kids Bux assume feature. Way faster and easier than other apps! We found in our own use that daily tracking by parents became a chore (for the parent!), so we developed the feature to save our precious time.Kids Bux allows parents to enter a weekly allowance that is automatically added (as needed) to the child’s account when you logon. Parents also enter children’s chores as daily, bi-weekly, weekly, or monthly. Chores not done are marked, and a money penalty is taken from the child’s total. See how quick that is! Only mark those not done – this is an enormous timesaver for busy families.Also our core feature of money tracking has been improved. Use Kids Bux to add money to the child’s account, and withdraw when money is spent. Always know how much money the child has.All data is stored in the cloud, so if both parents have the app, each has an instant update to the child’s account, knowing at all times how much the child can (or cannot!) spend.\n",

The result is a CNBC style, two layer, multi speed scrolling stock ticker that not only looks cool, but provides you with up to date quotes for your entire portfolio in a small amount of space. Recommended use is to put individual stocks on the upper watchlist while major global indices and/or currencies on the lower watchlist.This is a widget and requires one full line of space.
