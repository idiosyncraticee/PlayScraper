Are you considering the yield to worst rate of return?This calculator is essential when comparing preferred shares that you are evaluating, because all rates of return are computed.Many preferred shares may be called by the issuer.

These lower or raise your actual rate of return.

Your money is important!Just enter in how much you want to invest in a company, and the program will tell you how many shares you can buy, and the money you can make if you sell it at a certain price. Extremely handy on making stock purchase decisions. There have many stocks I thought were a great buy, but this app made me realize they weren't as great as i thought - same goes for the other end!

      "PairFinder is an app to find cointegrated stocks to pair trade. When two stocks are cointegrated, it means they move in the same direction at the same time. When one stock goes up, the other goes up too, and when one goes down, the other goes down. A regression is calculated on the historical stock prices, and an equation is determined for the stocks. Then one stock is calculated as a multiple of another, plus a constant value, and a 'random' error variable. The random error is calculated at each point by subtracting the expected value of the second stock from its actual value. This random value is then statistically analyzed to determine if it is a 'stationary', 'constant' random variable, or if it drifts and is a 'random walk'. If the probability is > 95%, then it is (most likely) a constant random value, and the two stocks are cointegrated. If the probability is < 95%, then the random variable drifts, and the two stocks are not cointegrated. The cointegration test is an Engle-Granger test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for 'unit roots' in the random value 'residuals'. Pair trading is a method used by advanced hedge funds to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. When stocks A and B are cointegrated, they will normally be the same 'distance' apart. When they diverge or converge, a trading opportunity presents itself for profit. If stocks A and B diverge, A goes up while stock B goes down. A trade is made to sell (short) stock A, and buy (long) stock B. When A and B converge and come back together, then stock A is bought back (buy to cover) and stock B is sold. Pair trading is a low risk, low capital exposure trading strategy. Trade are open for a few days or a few weeks, and the capital required is minimal due to selling and buying stocks at the same time.PairFinder requires a subscription of $0.99/m.  Background data must be enabled for the license server.Invalid symbols are shown as 0% probability, as are symbols that are missing price history for a given time (ex.

The cointegration test is an Engle-Granger test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for 'unit roots' in the random value 'residuals'. Pair trading is a method used by advanced hedge funds to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. When stocks A and B are cointegrated, they will normally be the same 'distance' apart. When they diverge or converge, a trading opportunity presents itself for profit. If stocks A and B diverge, A goes up while stock B goes down. A trade is made to sell (short) stock A, and buy (long) stock B. When A and B converge and come back together, then stock A is bought back (buy to cover) and stock B is sold. Pair trading is a low risk, low capital exposure trading strategy. Trade are open for a few days or a few weeks, and the capital required is minimal due to selling and buying stocks at the same time.PairFinder requires a subscription of $0.99/m.

      "PairFinder is an app to find cointegrated stocks to pair trade. When two stocks are cointegrated, it means they move in the same direction at the same time. When one stock goes up, the other goes up too, and when one goes down, the other goes down. A regression is calculated on the historical stock prices, and an equation is determined for the stocks. Then one stock is calculated as a multiple of another, plus a constant value, and a 'random' error variable. The random error is calculated at each point by subtracting the expected value of the second stock from its actual value.

      "PairFinder is an app to find cointegrated stocks to pair trade. When two stocks are cointegrated, it means they move in the same direction at the same time. When one stock goes up, the other goes up too, and when one goes down, the other goes down. A regression is calculated on the historical stock prices, and an equation is determined for the stocks. Then one stock is calculated as a multiple of another, plus a constant value, and a 'random' error variable. The random error is calculated at each point by subtracting the expected value of the second stock from its actual value. This random value is then statistically analyzed to determine if it is a 'stationary', 'constant' random variable, or if it drifts and is a 'random walk'. If the probability is > 95%, then it is (most likely) a constant random value, and the two stocks are cointegrated. If the probability is < 95%, then the random variable drifts, and the two stocks are not cointegrated. The cointegration test is an Engle-Granger test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for 'unit roots' in the random value 'residuals'. Pair trading is a method used by advanced hedge funds to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. When stocks A and B are cointegrated, they will normally be the same 'distance' apart. When they diverge or converge, a trading opportunity presents itself for profit. If stocks A and B diverge, A goes up while stock B goes down. A trade is made to sell (short) stock A, and buy (long) stock B. When A and B converge and come back together, then stock A is bought back (buy to cover) and stock B is sold. Pair trading is a low risk, low capital exposure trading strategy. Trade are open for a few days or a few weeks, and the capital required is minimal due to selling and buying stocks at the same time.PairFinder requires a subscription of $0.99/m.

      "Light Check lets you generate images of checks from any checking or draft account.  You can use them to pay anyone who has a remote deposit feature on their bank, including smartphone apps with camera deposit, or direct banking accounts that let you upload check images to the web.The app does not connect to the internet, and no third party account is required, so your confidential payment information remains safe.The checks are generated using the United States standard for check formatting.  All you need is a blank check, or your account information from your bank.  Enter the information into Light Check, including the account holder's name and address, and the routing and account numbers.  Then draft a check for a certain amount to a recipient and sign the check.   Saving specific account information is optional, and no information ever leaves your device, except to your trusted payment recipients.For visual payment in person, 7\" and 10\" high resolution tablets work best.  For devices above 7\", a screen pixel density of more than 120 ppi is recommended.  For devices above 3.5\", a screen pixel density of more than 200 ppi is recommended.Some banks treat remote deposits differently.  You can test Light Check with your bank using the Light Check Lite free application which will only draft checks for $3.50.  We can't guarantee your specific bank will accept LIght Checks right away, but if you contact us with any problems, we will try our best to rectify any rejections.Learn more at http://www.getlightcheck.com/guide.html\n",

This is how it happens with the app and it generates the time as well as the numbers, being the closest simulation to the real lottery draw. You can choose how many even and odd numbers generate the app and play. Players may pick 6 different numbers from 1 to 49. You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing. In a typical 6/49 game, six numbers are drawn from a range of 49 and if the six numbers on a ticket match the numbers drawn, the ticket holder is a jackpot winner - this is true no matter in which order the numbers appear. The probability of this happening is 1 in 13,983,816.There are three types of probabilities, each differing only in interpretation but still subject to the same rules:Mathematical    The theoretical development based on equally likely outcomes and their far-reaching generalization into measure theory. Empirical    Events are assigned probabilities based on empirical observations from the past. Subjective    This was championed by the Italian mathematician Bruno de Finetti and views probabilities as personal reflections of an individual's opinion about an event. The probabilities associated with Lotto 6/49 are determined by calculations based on equally likely outcomes but their interpretation is empirical, as follows. If an experiment (such as a weekly Lotto drawing) is repeated under similar conditions many times (mathematically the requisite number of times must approach infinity) then the probability of an event is the long run proportion of experimental repetitions on which the event occurs. (This is called a law of large numbers. It is a mathematical result only.) As illustration, the probability of obtaining a fourth place prize is 0.0009686. This means that in 26,000 Lotto draws, each particular choice of six numbers will yield a fourth place prize (matching exactly 4 numbers) on approximately 0.0009686 of those plays, that is 26000 x 0.000986 = 25 times. There is no guarantee that this will happen 25 times. The actual number of times is random and subject to what is called the Poisson approximation. The figure of 25 represents an expected number of winnings and is a useful measure by which to compare the performance of different strategies.Odd numbers are those which end in 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 while even numbers are those which end in 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8. You are more likely to win if your odd-even number combination is either 2-4, 3-3 or 4-2. More than 70% of the winning combinations in all the lotteries 6/49 in the past two years are in these category.----------TIPS: Generate almost equal numbers odd/even, until you see your favorite number. Mathematically, these numbers you have to play about 25 times. It is not easy but it is the best way to win!---------For further details or any questions please send me an email at: office@mylotto-app.com Disclaimer: This application has no link in no way with any Lotteries 6/49 organism and it does not allow to participate in the official game of any Lotteries 6/49.

More than 70% of the winning combinations in all the lotteries 6/49 in the past two years are in these category.----------TIPS: Generate almost equal numbers odd/even, until you see your favorite number. Mathematically, these numbers you have to play about 25 times. It is not easy but it is the best way to win!---------For further details or any questions please send me an email at: office@mylotto-app.com Disclaimer: This application has no link in no way with any Lotteries 6/49 organism and it does not allow to participate in the official game of any Lotteries 6/49.
